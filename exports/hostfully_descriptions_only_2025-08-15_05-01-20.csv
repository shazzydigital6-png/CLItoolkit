","Located where the Peak's Addition, Historic Swiss and Bryan Place neighborhoods meet, our Airbnb is possibly in the most centrally located area of Dallas.  Easy to get everywhere while still having a cozy feel.

The Peak’s Addition neighborhood is nestled conveniently between Deep Ellum and Lakewood.  With over 500 rooftops, our neighborhood boasts architecture from the Queen Anne Victorian Era, Prairie-style, Craftsman, and modern, contemporary architecture as well.  The diversity of its homes is as cool as the diversity of its people, and is what makes our neighborhood unique and dynamic. 

Peak’s Addition is the closest East Dallas neighborhood to Downtown Dallas and Deep Ellum.   Much of our land is protected by the Historic District Overlay and Single Family zoning, securing our neighborhood's future.

Outside of the impressive architecture, some of our greatest assets are the people who live and work here.  Most of the people who live in Peak’s Addition are involved in the community, volunteer, and are invested in making Dallas better.  We are neighbors.

 What the neighbors love best about our location is accessibility and convenience.  Many of us claim we never have to go North of Mockingbird for anything and some are abandoning their vehicles for bikes now that Downtown Dallas is becoming more pedestrian friendly.  We have access to all of the great commercial districts Dallas has to offer without the traffic and congestion.  And a big bonus,...we have big yards, porches,  parks and green space!

The Swiss Avenue Historic District is a diverse neighborhood containing the finest collection of Early 20th Century residential architecture in the entire Southwest. Established in 1905 by real-estate developer, Robert Munger, it was designated in 1973 as the first historic district in the City of Dallas.

About the Munger Place Historic District

As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.

The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. 

Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the ""right"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.

The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.","Important Layout Information:
Our home offers a unique layout that provides flexibility for different guest arrangements. Here’s what to know about accessing the space:

Entering from the back: If you enter from the back of the property, you'll pass through the black bedroom to reach the front two bedrooms, kitchen, and living room.

Entering from the front: For easy access to the kitchen, living room, and front bedrooms without passing through the black bedroom, you can enter through the front of the property.

Guests in the black bedroom: If you're staying in the black bedroom and prefer not to walk through the second bedroom, you can step outside through the back door, walk around to the front of the property, and enter through the front door to access the main living spaces.


We’ve designed the space to be flexible, with many of our guests enjoying the option to use the front and back sections independently, depending on their needs.

If you have any specific questions about this layout please ask us this BEFORE booking the space.","AMENITIES HIGHLIGHTS

About the Munger Place Historic District

As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.

The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. 

Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the ""right"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.

The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.","Important Layout Information:

To attract the ""right"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.

The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.","Shared courtyard terrace.","Luxury and contemporary finishes.

About the Munger Place Historic District

As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.

The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. 

Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the ""right"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas.

Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.","The bedroom features a king-size Serenity hybrid mattress with 300-thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets, down goose and latex pillows, and eucalyptic organic home diffusers for a restful night’s sleep. Designer low-voltage recessed lighting, hardwood floors, and coffered ceilings create a cozy yet elevated atmosphere, while mirrored accents enhance the sense of space.

About the Munger Place Historic District

As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.

The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. 

Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the ""right"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.

The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.","AMENITIES HIGHLIGHTS

The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. 

Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the ""right"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.

The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.","AMENITIES HIGHLIGHTS

Lakewood is a vibrant neighborhood in Dallas with trees, greenery and historic mansions.

A quiet, woody neighborhood less than 15 minutes from Downtown Dallas, Lakewood overlooks beautiful White Rock Lake and is home to the Lakewood Country Club.

The area’s homes offer everything from two-bedroom bungalows to vast estates in a variety of architectural styles: Tudor, Colonial, Spanish and French Eclectic are common. Newer homes in the area showcase many different styles including French, Mediterranean, Craftsman, Prairie, and contemporary Mid-Century Modern-styles.

The Lakewood Shopping Center is easily identified by the art deco spire atop the iconic Lakewood Theater. The center features a diverse collection of restaurants and shopping venues that serve as the neighborhood’s town square. One of the year’s highlights is the charming Lakewood Fourth of July Parade and Celebration. It reflects the small-time feel in the middle of the city that Lakewood is known for.

Residents here like to live life outdoors. Numerous outdoor activities include jogging, cycling, sailing, kayaking, paddle boarding, rowing, or just playing with kids and dogs at the beautiful neighborhood parks.","	•	2 bedrooms with premium linens

About the neighborhood.

Lakewood is a vibrant neighborhood in Dallas with trees, greenery and historic mansions.

A quiet, woody neighborhood less than 15 minutes from Downtown Dallas, Lakewood overlooks beautiful White Rock Lake and is home to the Lakewood Country Club.

The area’s homes offer everything from two-bedroom bungalows to vast estates in a variety of architectural styles: Tudor, Colonial, Spanish and French Eclectic are common. Newer homes in the area showcase many different styles including French, Mediterranean, Craftsman, Prairie, and contemporary Mid-Century Modern-styles.

The Lakewood Shopping Center is easily identified by the art deco spire atop the iconic Lakewood Theater. The center features a diverse collection of restaurants and shopping venues that serve as the neighborhood’s town square. One of the year’s highlights is the charming Lakewood Fourth of July Parade and Celebration. It reflects the small-time feel in the middle of the city that Lakewood is known for.

Residents here like to live life outdoors. Numerous outdoor activities include jogging, cycling, sailing, kayaking, paddle boarding, rowing, or just playing with kids and dogs at the beautiful neighborhood parks. ",,,,"(1) General Parking.

About the neighborhood.

Lakewood is a vibrant neighborhood in Dallas with trees, greenery and historic mansions.

A quiet, woody neighborhood less than 15 minutes from Downtown Dallas, Lakewood overlooks beautiful White Rock Lake and is home to the Lakewood Country Club.

The area’s homes offer everything from two-bedroom bungalows to vast estates in a variety of architectural styles: Tudor, Colonial, Spanish and French Eclectic are common. Newer homes in the area showcase many different styles including French, Mediterranean, Craftsman, Prairie, and contemporary Mid-Century Modern-styles.

The Lakewood Shopping Center is easily identified by the art deco spire atop the iconic Lakewood Theater. The center features a diverse collection of restaurants and shopping venues that serve as the neighborhood’s town square. One of the year’s highlights is the charming Lakewood Fourth of July Parade and Celebration. It reflects the small-time feel in the middle of the city that Lakewood is known for.
