Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""AMENITIES HIGHLIGHTS\nSleep 8 Technology Beds in all rooms\n\n\n300TC Egyptian Cotton Sheets\n\n\n800 GSM Turkish Cotton Towels\n\n\nHigh-Speed Wi-Fi\n\n\nViking Appliances & Fully Equipped Kitchen\n\n\nNespresso Coffee & Selection of Coffees/Teas\n\n\nGarden View\n\n\nAward-Winning Courtyard w/ Cooling System\n\n\nPrivate Bathrooms for Each Bedroom\n\n"",""houseManual"":""1.

The property is a newly restored, 1930 landmark is central to Deep Ellum and Lakewood.\n\nAbout the Munger Place Historic District\n\nAs you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""Located on the second floor, this stunning condo offers all the light and space needed for a short or long-term stay.

My Airbnb is minutes from Deep Ellum, Lakewood, West Village, and Downtown. Essentially, it's in the center of town. Some top tourist attractions include Dallas Convention Center, the American Airlines Center (home to the Dallas Mavericks and Dallas Stars), the House of Blues and the Perot Museum of Nature museum all attractions.\n\nLocated in one of the most prestigious and sought after historic neighborhoods in Dallas.  This truly one of a kind gem is surrounded by historic turn of the century estate, 100 year old trees on street lit up by historic lamp lighting  and is biking distance to all of Dallas' most popular neighborhoods. The property is a newly restored, 1930 landmark is central to Deep Ellum and Lakewood.\n\nAbout the Munger Place Historic District\n\nAs you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""Located on the second floor, this stunning condo offers all the light and space needed for a short or long-term stay.

Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down.

Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down.

Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""#DallasLuxuryStay #ExecutiveCondo #VikingKitchen #AwardWinningCourtyard #HistoricMunger #KingBedRetreat #RitzyRoom #LuxuryAmenities #DallasGetaway #WorkAndLeisure\n"",""houseManual"":""1.

Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""The private patio provides a peaceful retreat, while your stay includes access to our exclusive off-site pool and private work center — ideal for balancing leisure and productivity."",""houseManual"":""1.

Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard.\n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least $2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""The open-concept living area features plush seating, Smart TV entertainment, and a fully equipped kitchen for home-cooked meals.

Multiple parks throughout lower east Dallas lie on the trail route (a former railroad right of way). It currently connects to both the White Rock Lake Park Loop Trail and the Union Pacific Trail. We are located close to the Munger Place Historic District as well. \n\nAbout the Munger Place Historic District\n\nAs you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""This newly remodeled retreat is great for either a short or long-term stay.

Newer homes in the area showcase many different styles including French, Mediterranean, Craftsman, Prairie, and contemporary Mid-Century Modern-styles.\n\nThe Lakewood Shopping Center is easily identified by the art deco spire atop the iconic Lakewood Theater.
