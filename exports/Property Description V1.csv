Easy to get everywhere while still having a cozy feel. The Peak’s Addition neighborhood is nestled conveniently between Deep Ellum and Lakewood. With over 500 rooftops, our neighborhood boasts architecture from the Queen Anne Victorian Era, Prairie-style, Craftsman, and modern, contemporary architecture as well. The diversity of its homes is as cool as the diversity of its people, and is what makes our neighborhood unique and dynamic. Peak’s Addition is the closest East Dallas neighborhood to Downtown Dallas and Deep Ellum. Much of our land is protected by the Historic District Overlay and Single Family zoning, securing our neighborhood's future. Outside of the impressive architecture, some of our greatest assets are the people who live and work here. Most of the people who live in Peak’s Addition are involved in the community, volunteer, and are invested in making Dallas better. We are neighbors. What the neighbors love best about our location is accessibility and convenience. Many of us claim we never have to go North of Mockingbird for anything and some are abandoning their vehicles for bikes now that Downtown Dallas is becoming more pedestrian friendly. We have access to all of the great commercial districts Dallas has to offer without the traffic and congestion. And a big bonus,...we have big yards, porches, parks and green space! The Swiss Avenue Historic District is a diverse neighborhood containing the finest collection of Early 20th Century residential architecture in the entire Southwest. Established in 1905 by real-estate developer, Robert Munger, it was designated in 1973 as the first historic district in the City of Dallas. It is an official Dallas Landmark District and, in 1974, the entire District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",1970,"Our celebrated courtyard—voted Best in Dallas—features a luxury water/fog cooling system that can drop temperatures by up to 20 degrees in summer.

Easy to get everywhere while still having a cozy feel.  The Peak’s Addition neighborhood is nestled conveniently between Deep Ellum and Lakewood.  With over 500 rooftops, our neighborhood boasts architecture from the Queen Anne Victorian Era, Prairie-style, Craftsman, and modern, contemporary architecture as well.  The diversity of its homes is as cool as the diversity of its people, and is what makes our neighborhood unique and dynamic.   Peak’s Addition is the closest East Dallas neighborhood to Downtown Dallas and Deep Ellum.   Much of our land is protected by the Historic District Overlay and Single Family zoning, securing our neighborhood's future.  Outside of the impressive architecture, some of our greatest assets are the people who live and work here.  Most of the people who live in Peak’s Addition are involved in the community, volunteer, and are invested in making Dallas better.  We are neighbors.   What the neighbors love best about our location is accessibility and convenience.  Many of us claim we never have to go North of Mockingbird for anything and some are abandoning their vehicles for bikes now that Downtown Dallas is becoming more pedestrian friendly.  We have access to all of the great commercial districts Dallas has to offer without the traffic and congestion.  And a big bonus,...we have big yards, porches,  parks and green space!  The Swiss Avenue Historic District is a diverse neighborhood containing the finest collection of Early 20th Century residential architecture in the entire Southwest. Established in 1905 by real-estate developer, Robert Munger, it was designated in 1973 as the first historic district in the City of Dallas. It is an official Dallas Landmark District and, in 1974, the entire District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.","Our celebrated courtyard—voted Best in Dallas—features a luxury water/fog cooling system that can drop temperatures by up to 20 degrees in summer.

Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk. The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the """"right"""" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home. The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down.

Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk. The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the """"right"""" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home. The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.",2840,"🌿 Award-Winning Courtyard Retreat 🌿 Voted Best in Dallas, our courtyard is a year-round sanctuary.

About the Munger Place Historic District As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk. The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the """"right"""" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home. The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down.

This truly one of a kind gem is surrounded by historic turn of the century estate, 100 year old trees on street lit up by historic lamp lighting  and is biking distance to all of Dallas' most popular neighborhoods. The property is a newly restored, 1937 landmark is central to Deep Ellum and Lakewood.\n\nAbout the Munger Place Historic District\n\nAs you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""Luxury and contemporary finishes.

About the Munger Place Historic District As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk. The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the """"right"""" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home. The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down.

About the Munger Place Historic District. Munger Place is one of the most prestigious and sought after historic neighborhood in Dallas. This truly one of a kind gem is surrounded by historic turn of the century estate, 100 year old trees on street lit up by historic lamp lighting biking distance to Downtown, Greenville or Deep Ellum. As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk. The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the """"right"""" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home. The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.",2463,"🌿 Award-Winning Courtyard Retreat 🌿 Our courtyard, voted Best in Dallas, offers the perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and charm.

About the Munger Place Historic District  As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.  The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard.   Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the ""right"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.  The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.","🌿 AWARD-WINNING COURTYARD RETREAT 🌿 Recognized as one of Dallas’ best-kept secrets and voted Best in Dallas, the private courtyard features a premium mist/fog cooling system that can lower summer temperatures by up to 20°F.

About the Munger Place Historic District As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk. The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the """"right"""" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home. The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down.

About the Munger Place Historic District  As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.  The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard.  Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the ""right"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least $2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.  The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.","🌿 AWARD-WINNING COURTYARD RETREAT 🌿 Step into one of Dallas’ best-kept secrets — our courtyard, voted Best in Dallas, where comfort meets luxury.

Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk.\n\nThe Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. \n\nMunger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the \""right\"" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home.\n\nThe Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces."",""space"":""Inside, enjoy a spacious living area appointed with designer furnishings, a plush king-size bed dressed in hotel-quality linens, and a stylish bath.

About the Munger Place Historic District As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk. The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the """"right"""" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home. The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.",2824,"🌿 Award-Winning Courtyard Retreat 🌿 Step into one of Dallas’ best-kept secrets—our courtyard, voted Best in Dallas, is the perfect blend of comfort, luxury, and outdoor charm.

About the Munger Place Historic District As you step back into the early 20th century, the neighborhood not only looks like something from yesteryear, but the neighbors talk to each other and there are neighborhood events that are planned regularly. Our member events include porch parties, jack-o-lantern carving, Easter egg hunts and more. Munger Place also has public events like Halloween and the Home Tour and/or Wine Walk. The Munger Place neighborhood has been named a Historical District, it requires each home owner to make decisions within the Historic District Ordinance. The Ordinance helps us keep the look and feel very much like it was when the neighborhood was built in the early 1900's. However, it also includes stipulations on the color of paint that is used, how the repairs or restoration of the home is done, and the items, plants and grass used to landscaping the yard. Munger Place was established in 1905 by cotton gin manufacturer Robert S. Munger on 300 acres as one of Dallas's first suburbs, and was originally intended to be one of the most exclusive communities in the city. To attract the """"right"""" social element, Munger Place was carefully planned. Just minutes from downtown Dallas by carriage, Munger Place became the very first deed-restricted neighborhood in Texas. Homes had to be a full two stories, cost at least US$2,000 and no house could face a side street. The infrastructure featured such amenities as sidewalks, paved streets, shade trees, sewers, gas mains, and electric street lights. Many of the Dallas' leading businessmen and social elite soon called magnificent Munger Place home. The Great Depression led many of the community's mansions to be converted into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elite cachet, and by the 1960s many of the nicer houses in the area had been torn down. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces.",2651,"🌿 AWARD-WINNING COURTYARD RETREAT 🌿 Step into one of Dallas’ most celebrated outdoor spaces—our courtyard, voted Best in Dallas.

Lakewood is a vibrant neighborhood in Dallas with trees, greenery and historic mansions.  A quiet, woody neighborhood less than 15 minutes from Downtown Dallas, Lakewood overlooks beautiful White Rock Lake and is home to the Lakewood Country Club.  The area’s homes offer everything from two-bedroom bungalows to vast estates in a variety of architectural styles: Tudor, Colonial, Spanish and French Eclectic are common. Newer homes in the area showcase many different styles including French, Mediterranean, Craftsman, Prairie, and contemporary Mid-Century Modern-styles.  The Lakewood Shopping Center is easily identified by the art deco spire atop the iconic Lakewood Theater. The center features a diverse collection of restaurants and shopping venues that serve as the neighborhood’s town square. One of the year’s highlights is the charming Lakewood Fourth of July Parade and Celebration. It reflects the small-time feel in the middle of the city that Lakewood is known for.
